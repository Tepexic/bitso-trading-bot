## Quick Start

1. **Clone and Setup**:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/tepexic/GitHub/pi-trader
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure API Credentials**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Bitso API credentials
   ```

3. **Test API Connection**:

   ```bash
   python test_api.py
   ```

4. **Run the Bot**:
   ```bash
   python src/trading_bot.py
   ```

## Configuration

Edit the `.env` file with your settings:

```env
# Bitso API Configuration
BITSO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BITSO_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
BITSO_USE_STAGING=True  # Set to False for production

# Trading Configuration
TRADING_PAIR=eth_mxn
TRADE_AMOUNT=100.0
STOP_LOSS_PERCENTAGE=5.0
TAKE_PROFIT_PERCENTAGE=10.0

# Bot Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES=5
DRY_RUN=True  # Set to False for live trading
```

**Environment Settings:**

- `BITSO_USE_STAGING=True`: Use Bitso's staging environment for testing
- `BITSO_USE_STAGING=False`: Use Bitso's production environment for live trading

## Getting Bitso API Credentials

1. Log in to your Bitso account
2. Go to API section in your account settings
3. Create a new API key with trading permissions
4. Copy the API Key and Secret to your `.env` file

**Important**: Never share your API credentials or commit them to version control.

## Trading Strategies ðŸ“Š

The bot implements three sophisticated trading strategies that you can switch between using the `STRATEGY` environment variable:

### 1. Moving Average (MA) Strategy ðŸ“ˆ

**What it does:**

- Uses two moving averages: a short-term (10 periods) and long-term (30 periods)
- A moving average smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price over a specific time period

**Signals:**

- **Buy Signal**: When the short MA (10-period) crosses **above** the long MA (30-period)
  - Indicates upward momentum - recent prices are higher than the longer-term average
  - Example: If ETH's 10-day average becomes higher than its 30-day average, it suggests a bullish trend
- **Sell Signal**: When the short MA crosses **below** the long MA
  - Indicates downward momentum - recent prices are falling below the longer-term trend

**Best for:** Trending markets, trend following
**Pros:** Simple and reliable, reduces noise from short-term fluctuations
**Cons:** Lag indicator (signals come after trend has started), false signals in choppy markets

### 2. RSI Strategy ðŸŽ¯

**What it does:**

- RSI (Relative Strength Index) measures the speed and magnitude of price changes
- Ranges from 0 to 100, indicating if an asset is oversold or overbought
- Formula: `RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))` where `RS = Average Gain / Average Loss`

**Signals:**

- **Buy Signal**: When RSI < 30 (oversold condition)
  - Suggests the asset has been sold too aggressively and may bounce back
  - Example: If ETH's RSI drops to 25, it might be a good buying opportunity
- **Sell Signal**: When RSI > 70 (overbought condition)
  - Suggests the asset has been bought too aggressively and may correct downward

**Best for:** Range-bound markets, identifying reversal points
**Pros:** More responsive than moving averages, great for spotting extremes
**Cons:** Can stay overbought/oversold for extended periods in strong trends

### 3. Combined Strategy ðŸŽ¯ðŸ“ˆ

**What happens when combined:**

**Buy Signal (Conservative Approach):**

- **BOTH** MA and RSI must agree (`ma_buy AND rsi_buy`)
- MA says "trend is up" AND RSI says "oversold, ready to bounce"
- Creates more conservative, higher-confidence buy signals
- Example: Short MA crosses above long MA AND RSI is below 30

**Sell Signal (Protective Approach):**

- **EITHER** MA or RSI suggests selling (`ma_sell OR rsi_sell`)
- If MA says "trend is down" OR RSI says "overbought", then sell
- Creates a more protective exit strategy

**Why this combination works:**

1. **Trend + Momentum**: MA identifies trend direction, RSI identifies momentum extremes
2. **Reduced False Signals**: Requiring both indicators to agree for buying reduces whipsaws
3. **Quick Exits**: Allowing either indicator to trigger a sell helps preserve profits

**Best for:** All market conditions, risk-averse traders
**Pros:** Higher quality signals, better risk management
**Cons:** Fewer trading opportunities, may miss some profitable trades

### Strategy Comparison

| Strategy     | Best For          | Signal Frequency      | Risk Level | Best Markets   |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| **MA**       | Trend following   | Fewer, later          | Medium     | Trending       |
| **RSI**      | Mean reversion    | More frequent         | Higher     | Range-bound    |
| **Combined** | Balanced approach | Fewer, higher quality | Lower      | All conditions |

### Configuration

Choose your strategy in `.env`:

```bash
STRATEGY=ma          # Moving Average only
STRATEGY=rsi         # RSI only
STRATEGY=combined    # Both strategies combined (default)
```

### Tunable Parameters

Customize strategy behavior with these environment variables:

```bash
# Moving Average Settings
MA_SHORT_PERIOD=10      # Short moving average window
MA_LONG_PERIOD=30       # Long moving average window

# RSI Settings
RSI_PERIOD=14           # RSI calculation period
RSI_OVERSOLD=30         # RSI buy threshold
RSI_OVERBOUGHT=70       # RSI sell threshold
```

## Risk Management

- **Stop Loss**: Automatically sell if price drops by specified percentage
- **Take Profit**: Automatically sell if price rises by specified percentage
- **Position Sizing**: Fixed amount per trade (configurable)
- **Dry Run Mode**: Test without real money

## Safety Recommendations

1. **Start with Dry Run**: Always test with `DRY_RUN=True` first
2. **Small Amounts**: Start with small trade amounts
3. **Monitor Closely**: Watch the bot's performance especially initially
4. **Regular Backups**: Keep backups of your configuration and logs
5. **API Permissions**: Only give necessary permissions to your API key

## Raspberry Pi Setup

For optimal performance on Raspberry Pi:

1. **Install Python 3.8+**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv
   ```

2. **Install System Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-matplotlib python3-pandas
   ```

3. **Set Up Service** (optional):
   ```bash
   # Create systemd service for auto-start
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/pi-trader.service
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Authentication Errors**:

   - Check API credentials in `.env`
   - Verify API key has trading permissions
   - Ensure account is verified and active

2. **Network Issues**:

   - Check internet connection
   - Verify firewall settings
   - Test with `python test_api.py`

3. **Insufficient Data**:
   - Bot needs time to collect price history
   - Wait for at least 50 data points before trading

### Getting Help

1. Check the logs in `logs/trading_bot.log`
2. Run `python test_api.py` to verify setup
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Check Bitso API documentation for any changes
